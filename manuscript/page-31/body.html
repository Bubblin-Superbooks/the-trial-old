<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> K. knew very well that this room had recently been let to a typist called 'Miss Buerstner'. She was in the habit of going out to work very early and coming back home very late, and K. had never exchanged more than a few words of greeting with her. Now, her bedside table had been pulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk for these proceedings, and the supervisor sat behind it. He had his legs crossed, and had thrown one arm over the backrest of the chair.</p><p>In one corner of the room there were three young people looking at the photographs belonging to Miss Buerstner that had been put into a piece of fabric on the wall. Hung up on the handle of the open window was a white blouse.</p></div> </div>
