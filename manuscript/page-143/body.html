But I'll come straight back and then I'll go with you if you'll take me, I'll go wherever you want, you can do whatever you like with me, I'll be happy if I can be away from here for as long as possible, it'd be best if I could get away from here for good."

He really was attracted to the woman, and even after thinking hard about it could find no good reason why he should not give in to her allure.</p></div> </div>
